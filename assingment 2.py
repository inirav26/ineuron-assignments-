## equal to compares two value while assignment operator  stores value for perticuler variable. 

# a = 12 ( ## assignment operator)

if spam == 10:
   print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
   print('bacon')
else:
   print('ham')
   print('spam')
   print('spam')

## here value of spam is 0  . in followimg condition if spaam value is quals to 10 than jt shold be printed egg . if value of spaam is greator than 5 than it should be printed 5 other wise print ham , spam , spam . because value is 0

if spam == 1:
   print("hello")
elif spam ==2:
   print("howdy")

## The break statement will move the execution outside loop 
## The continue statement will move the execution to the start of the loop.
